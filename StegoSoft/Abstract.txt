Steganography is the art and science of writing hidden messages in
such a way that no one, apart from the sender and intended recipient,
suspects the existence of the message. Steganography, in general, relies
on the imperfection of the human auditory and visual systems.

The project is aimed to embed any kind of message into the carrier
audio file. Audio steganography takes advantage of the psychoacoustical
masking phenomenon of the human auditory system. The features
provided by the software is described as follows:
1. Multiple messages file support in a single audio file.
2. The message can be of any type i.e., an image, text, video, etc.
3. Password protection and Encryption.
4. Least possible distortion in quality of audio file after hiding the
   message file by skipping few LSBs when storing consecutive bits of
   message file.
5. Feature rich header structure to facilitate data hiding.
6. User-friendly Graphical User Interface.

The software, Programming Languages and Libraries used to
develop this project are as follows:
1. Programming Languages: C, Python.
2. Python Libraries Used: PyQt4, os, sys, python-crypto.
3. GUI Interface Designer Used: Qt-Designer.
4. Utility Used: pyuic4.

Future Scope:
1. Adding support for Windows and MAC OS.
2. Adding support for other popular audio formats.
3. Adding a web based interface.
4. Adding multiple encryption technology support.
5. Adding themes in GUI.
